== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the plugin does not have it's own CSS? =
Because we think that the aspect of the polls must suite perfectly the theme settings and each theme has its rules for radio buttons, fieldsets and labels.

= Can I allow anonymous vote? =
No, actually the plugin supports only authenticated users. Maybe we could implement into a next version.

= Why I'm not able to change polls already rated by some users? =
We think that after one user has expressed it's preference anyone must change the answers.
So we have developed in this way.

= How can I ask support for this plugin? =
We trust the plugin is really simple but, if it is too complicated for you, please use the support forum.
